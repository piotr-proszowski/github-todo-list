## Github Todo List
Bitbucket's [pull-request-tasks](https://bitbucket.org/blog/introducing-pull-request-tasks) substitute. 


When I receive some feedback on my pull request I like to go through them and create to do list. For example `- [ ] fix typo` or `- [ ] discuss this concept offline`. From time to time this list happens to be pretty big - especially when changes I propose are controversial. For this cases `Github Todo List` has been created. It gathers all those to do list items and help with navigating through them.

## Demo

## Install

Extension is not yet in Chrome Webstore - review is still pending. 

However, you can easily install extension in developer mode: https://bashvlas.com/blog/install-chrome-extension-in-developer-mode/

## Contribution

Suggestions and pull requests are welcomed! I'm not a frontend expert so I'm pretty sure there is a lot of room for improvement :)
